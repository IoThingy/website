# Reading sensors

## Constructor
The constructor registers a free peripheral slot to store its arguments. The
constructors uses setter methods to set the invidual variables and defaults. 
This is better than method chaining as it uses less memory of the stack
(memory is often scarce). 

```c
/**
 * Instantiate a plant peripheral with only an analog input pin to measure the
 * moisture level.
 */
int8_t plant( char name[], uint8_t moisture_pin ) {
  // Get free peripheral slot
  int8_t slot = peripheral_register( name, TYPE_PLANT );
  if( slot < 0 ) {
    return -1;
  }

  plant_set_moisture_pin( slot, moisture_pin );
  return slot;
} 


void plant_set_moisture_pin( uint8_t slot,uint8_t moisture_pin ) {
  SERIAL_DEBUG_S(F("- misture pin: "));
  SERIAL_DEBUG_I(moisture_pin);
  SERIAL_DEBUG_S(F("\n"));  

  peripherals[ slot ].pin01 = moisture_pin;
  peripheral_set_pin_mode( peripherals[slot].pin01, INPUT );
}
```

## Reading input pins
Every iteration we want to ready the moisture level sensor and store its value.
Implement a method with the name *&lt;name&gt;_read_input_pins*. This
method should only read and store values, but not update any output pins as
that will be done by another method.
```c
/**
 * Read the pin value(s) for an analog peripheral and store it in its value.
 */
void plant_read_input_pins( uint8_t slot ) {
  // Read analog input sensor.
  if( peripherals[slot].pin01 ) {
    peripherals[ slot ].val03.i = analogRead( peripherals[slot].pin01 );

    SERIAL_DEBUG_S(F("- read moisture: "));
    SERIAL_DEBUG_I( peripherals[ slot ].val03.i );
    SERIAL_DEBUG_S(F("\n"));
  }
}
```


## Publishing metrics
Reading the value from a sensor is useless unless you do something with it. In
most cases you want to publish the value of this sensor to a MQTT topic. 
Implement a method with the name *&lt;name&gt;_publish_metrics*. This
method should call the method *peripheral_publish_metric_int* or
*peripheral_publish_metric_float* to send a value to MQTT/Serial. The metric
name (3rd parameter) is used for the topic name:
*&lt;device&gt;/&lt;peripheral&gt;/&lt;metric&gt;
```c
/**
 * Publish metrics to MQTT/Serial.
 */
void plant_publish_metrics( uint8_t slot ) {
  peripheral_publish_metric_int( slot, peripherals[slot].val03.i, "moisture" );
}
```
