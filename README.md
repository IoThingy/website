# IoThingy
IoThingy is a framework for writing software for IoT devices. Each device
configures one or more peripherals which will publish their metrics through
MQTT and can listen for incoming commands. Multiple platforms are supported:
[Arduino](https://arduino.cc), [ESP8622](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266), [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).
